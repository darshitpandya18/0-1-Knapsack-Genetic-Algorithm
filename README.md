# Example Repository

Hi all! This repository of mine contains codes that are developed either as a part of coding challenges or random problem solving. Currently the repository has two folders.

  1. Approximating values of Pi and root(x)
  2. 0-1 knapsack using genetic algorithm

Describing the content of each in detail:

1. Approximating values of Pi and root(x): This folder contains two codes. First, python code for approximating value of root(x) using power series(taylor series) with reduced computations and reduced error margin. Second, the folder also contains python code for approximating the value of Pi(~3.14) using the numerical integration methods viz. Trapezoidal Method, Simpson Method, MidPoint and Monte-Carlo Method. 

2. 0-1 knapsack using genetic algorithm: This fodler contains implementation of Genetic Algorithm for the general problem 0-1 Knapsack. TO add a small note to this, genetic algorithm has been in place since the time of Darwin when the theory os evolution was explained. These days, genetic algorithm is used in the field of AI and Machine Learning.

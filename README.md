# 0/1 Knapsack using Genetic Algorithm

Hi all!  This repository contains implementation of Genetic Algorithm for the general problem 0-1 Knapsack. TO add a small note to this, genetic algorithm has been in place since the time of Darwin when the theory os evolution was explained. These days, genetic algorithm is used in the field of AI and Machine Learning.
